## Introduction

A few years ago we created Sputnik Network Bot - a bot for sending and receiving tips in crypto on Telegram and Twitter

Sputnik Network Bot allows for P2P-exchange between users

- [X (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/SputnikNetwork)
- [GitHub of Sputnik Network Bot - not of Sputnik App-chain!](https://github.com/SputnikNetwork)

At the moment, Sputnik Network Bot is a centralized solution to provide users with the most comfortable conditions:
- Instant sending of any number of transactions
- No transaction fees
- Sending several different types of cryptocurrencies at once
- Sending transactions not to addresses, but to Telegram and  X (Twitter) usernames

At the moment, more than 44 thousand transactions have been made within Sputnik Network Bot

The main users of Sputnik Network Bot are both ordinary users of Telegram and X (Twitter), as well as various projects from the Cosmos Ecosystem that use Sputnik Network Bot to send funds to users for participation in various ambassador companies

It's time to expand the functionality of Sputnik Network Bot, and for this we are launching a blockchain!
